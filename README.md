## ENGI W4800 (3): Data Science Capstone & Ethics
### Instructor: Eleni Drinea

*Department:* Engineering  
*Title:* Data Science Capstone & Ethics  
*Credits*: 3  
*Prerequisite(s):* Faculty and approval-STAT W4105, CSOR 4246, STAT W4108, or equivalent

### Overview

This course provides a unique opportunity for students in the MS in Data Science program to apply their knowledge of the foundations, theory and methods of data science to address data driven problems in industry, government and the non-profit sector. The course activities focus on a semester-length project sponsored by a local organization. The project synthesizes the statistical, computational, engineering and social challenges involved in solving complex real-world problems.

*Teamwork:* four students will work together as a team on each project; groups will be selected by me to ensure group diversity based on student background and educational/professional experiences and interests in the available projects.

Each team is supervised by a mentor as projects typically progress through sequential phases. Students will meet as a cohort once a week where we will share best practices, and discuss relevant readings on topics including (1) entrepreneurship, (2) ethics, especially the ethics of mathematical models and algorithms, (3) process and design thinking, (4) strategic thinking, and (5) project management. Students will be expected to meet as a group outside of class in order for project and required deliverables to take shape. It is up to the groups to manage their tasks and time effectively.

**Phase 1:** (Week 1)  
Background and problem definition

**Phase 2:** (Weeks 2 & 3)  
Data wrangling, munging and cleaning

**Phase 3:** (Weeks 4 & 5)  
Exploratory Data Analysis 

**Phase 4:** (Weeks 6 & 7 & 8)   
Coding prototypes of algorithms and models

**Phase 5:** (Weeks 9 & 10)   
Data Visualization 

**Phase 6:** (Week 11)   
Reporting and communicating 

**Phase 7:** (Week 12)    
Productionizing any models or algorithms if applicable

*Examples of potential organizations:*    
+ Microsoft Research
+ Mediaocean
+ Bloomberg
+ Facebook
+ NYC Department of Education
+ Google
+ Amazon
+ Synergic Partners
+ Goldman Sachs

**Course Evaluation:** Late assignments (project presentations and reports) are not accepted without valid rationale.

*In class Project Presentations, 30%*    
Students will be expected to provide updates to the entire class on project development, insights, and next steps approximately every other week. Evaluation will be based on clear and concise thinking in alignment with course goals and quality of class presentations. More information about expectations will be discussed in class.



*Final Projects (Presentation & Reports), 50%*     
The bi-monthly group reports (see below)  will be essential in pulling together the final project. The final project should be a culmination of how the project synthesizes the statistical, computational, engineering and social challenges involved in solving complex real-world problems. Grade will be determined by the quality of the report and presentation. Each group is expected to give a 40-minute presentation with each group member presenting for 10 minutes. Keep in mind that I may not be the only one determining the quality. You will be expected to provide a self-assessment of your contributions to the work and that of your peers. Furthermore, your mentors (faculty and/or industry professionals) may be in attendance to your group presentations. More information about expectations and deadlines will be discussed in class.

*Phases 1-3 Literature Review and Analysis, 10%*    
Students will be expected to write an original paper aimed at synthesizing phases 1-3 course materials while discussing the implications of ethics and data science. More information about expectations and deadlines will be discussed in class,

*Phases 4-6 Literature Review and Analysis, 10%*     
Students will be expected to write an original paper aimed at synthesizing phases 4-6 course materials while discussing the implications of entrepreneurship and data science. More information about expectations and deadlines will be discussed in class.

This course requires a significant amount of writing, presentations, and collaboration outside of class. **Students will be expected to adhere to standards on Academic Integrity as outlined in the Bulletin.**
Students requiring accommodations should consult with the Office of Disability Services.


### Using git/github    
If you are new to git/github: you should first install git (see below). You should sign up for a github account if you don't have one and email me your usernames. Please go over the first two tutorials below carefully. You can also look at the Github help page for other things like cheat markdown basics, cheat sheets, etc.
